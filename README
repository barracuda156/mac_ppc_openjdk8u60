README:


jdk1.5 is the last officially supported java on Mac OSX 1.5 with PPC processor.

There is a functioning 1.7 jdk available based on openjdk1.7
download from https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/BSDPort/Darwin9Build
Although I've never been able to rebuild openjdk1.7 for mac PPC I could use this bootstrap
version to get necessary stuff working on my G5.

But 1.7 is old as well and sometimes I need a 1.8 version. 
I'm only interested in a headless version. Getting the graphics working might involve a lot of work.
I'm happy with a 1.8 version that is able to run some software e.g. OpenDA or running Bazel.

The current state of this project is that I have made all the (dirty) hacks to the openjdk codebase in order to compile
a 1.8 jdk that runs on OSX 1.5 with PPC processor. Depending on the needs I'll try to get more and more working in time.

I have made some changes in order to get the hotspot to compile and work. I'm not sure whether these  changes are correct but until now, when stuff runs it all seems to be stable.   

We use the assembly free zero hotspot and our hardware is old, hence performance is not super but at least some modern java stuff can now be run on Mac PPC

How to compile: download your bootstrap jkd 1.7 (https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/BSDPort/Darwin9Build)
set the location of your bootstrap jdk1/7 in build_nils.sh

. build_nils.sh

Should do the trick (I hope)

Have fun, I hope my work might be useful for others as well.


==== Original text of readme ====


  This file should be located at the top of the OpenJDK Mercurial root
  repository. A full OpenJDK repository set (forest) should also include
  the following 6 nested repositories:
    "jdk", "hotspot", "langtools", "corba", "jaxws"  and "jaxp".

  The root repository can be obtained with something like:
    hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8 openjdk8
  
  You can run the get_source.sh script located in the root repository to get
  the other needed repositories:
    cd openjdk8 && sh ./get_source.sh

  People unfamiliar with Mercurial should read the first few chapters of
  the Mercurial book: http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/

  See http://openjdk.java.net/ for more information about OpenJDK.

Simple Build Instructions:
  
  0. Get the necessary system software/packages installed on your system, see
     http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/raw-file/tip/README-builds.html

  1. If you don't have a jdk7u7 or newer jdk, download and install it from
     http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
     Add the /bin directory of this installation to your PATH environment
     variable.

  2. Configure the build:
       bash ./configure
  
  3. Build the OpenJDK:
       make all
     The resulting JDK image should be found in build/*/images/j2sdk-image

where make is GNU make 3.81 or newer, /usr/bin/make on Linux usually
is 3.81 or newer. Note that on Solaris, GNU make is called "gmake".

Complete details are available in the file:
